# Hello world R fun

This is dependant on the helloworldr package here [https://github.com/mortie23/helloworldr](https://github.com/mortie23/helloworldr).

Once you have this one working and the package built and deployed to a local private package repository, then you can follow with this one.

## Process

Firstly, running `renv::restore()` should install a cached copy of the private package to the `renv` directory.

## Run the function

Running `fun.R` should print "hello world" to the console.
